# TBRPG
A **T**urn-**B**ased **RPG** system made with an API connected to a cloud MongoDB database.

## Documentation

### List of technologies we use

- Made with PHP 7.3+ with MongoDB Extension 1.7.5;
- [Lumen 6.x](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs/6.x) to build a powerful REST API;
- [Atlas MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) to keep game changes and progress saving. We connected Mongo with Lumen throughout [Laravel MongoDB](https://github.com/jenssegers/laravel-mongodb), a great package made by [Jens Segers](https://github.com/jenssegers);
- [Ajax](https://github.com/fdaciuk/ajax) a Vanilla JS package to easily call the API from front-end. Made by [Fernando Daciuk](https://github.com/fdaciuk);
